This folder contains the written report

run assignment. The .java files related to each 
problem are as follows for your convienence... 	
						
Problem A: A2A, Farmer

Problem C: A2C, Client, CoffeeMachine		

PLEASE NOTE:
** for A2A farmers will cross bridge until neon
100 as requested. 
** for this assignment I used 'The Little Book of 
Semaphores' by Allen B. Downey as a resource.	
(all coding examples in The Little Book of 	
Semaphores are done in python so it was just 	
used more so as a starting point, and to further	
familiarize myself with semaphores)
